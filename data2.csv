We present an analytical method (SIANN: Strain Identification by Alignment to Near Neighbors) specifically designed to rapidly detect a set of target organisms in mixed samples that achieves a high degree of species- and strain-specificity by aligning short sequence reads to the genomes of near neighbor organisms, as well as that of the target. Empirical benchmarking alongside the current state-of-the-art methods shows an extremely high Positive Predictive Value, even at very low abundances of the target organism in a mixed sample. SIANN is available as an Illumina BaseSpace app, as well as through Signature Science, LLC. SIANN results are presented in a streamlined report designed to be comprehensible to the non-specialist user, providing a powerful tool for rapid species detection in a mixed sample. By focusing on a set of (customizable) target organisms and their near neighbors, SIANN can operate quickly and with low computational requirements while delivering highly accurate results.",2014-01-10,Samuel Minot; Stephen D Turner; Krista L Ternus; Dana R Kadavy,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/001727

Adapting to human immune system, emerging diseases may trigger large-scale pandemic spreading, such as the transnational spreading of SARS, the global outbreak of A(H1N1), and the recent potential invasion of avian influenza A(H7N9). To study the dynamics mediating the transmission of emerging diseases, spatial epidemiology of networked metapopulation provides a valuable modeling framework, which takes spatially distributed factors into consideration. This review elaborates the latest progresses on the spatial metapopulation dynamics, discusses empirical and theoretical findings that verify the validity of networked metapopulations, and the application in evaluating the effectiveness of disease intervention strategies as well.",2014-06-04,Lin WANG; Xiang Li,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/003889

We sequenced BAC clones from the essentially haploid hydatidiform mole, CHM1, across the light chain IG loci, kappa (IGK) and lambda (IGL), creating single haplotype representations of these regions. The IGL haplotype is 1.25Mb of contiguous sequence with four novel V gene and one novel C gene alleles and an 11.9kbp insertion. The IGK haplotype consists of two 644kbp proximal and 466kbp distal contigs separated by a gap also present in the reference genome sequence. Our effort added an additional 49kbp of unique sequence extending into this gap. The IGK haplotype contains six novel V gene and one novel J gene alleles and a 16.7kbp region with increased sequence identity between the two IGK contigs, exhibiting signatures of interlocus gene conversion. Our data facilitated the first comparison of nucleotide diversity between the light and IG heavy (IGH) chain haplotypes within a single genome, revealing a three to six fold enrichment in the IGH locus, supporting the theory that the heavy chain may be more important in determining antigenic specificity.",2014-07-03,Corey T Watson; Karyn Meltz Steinberg; Tina A Graves-Lindsay; Rene L Warren; Maika Malig; Jacqueline E Schein; Richard K Wilson; Rob Holt; Evan Eichler; Felix Breden,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/006866

The large amount of data generated provides an opportunity to detect species even at very low levels, provided that computational tools can effectively interpret potentially complex metagenomic mixtures. Data interpretation is complicated by the fact that short sequencing reads can match multiple organisms and by the lack of completeness of existing databases, in particular for viral pathogens. This interpretation problem can be formulated statistically as a mixture model, where the species of origin of each read is missing, but the complete knowledge of all species present in the mixture helps with the individual reads assignment. Several analytical tools have been proposed to approximately solve this computational problem. Here, we show that the use of parallel Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) for the exploration of the species space enables the identification of the set of species most likely to contribute to the mixture. The added accuracy comes at a cost of increased computation time. Our approach is useful for solving complex mixtures involving several related species. We designed our method specifically for the analysis of deep transcriptome sequencing datasets and with a particular focus on viral pathogen detection, but the principles are applicable more generally to all types of metagenomics mixtures.

Phylogenetic methods used to measure the degree of relatedness among sequenced viral samples have proven useful in identifying potential outbreak sources. The complex nature of infectious disease, however, makes it difficult to assign a rigorously defined quantitative confidence value assessing the likelihood of a true direct transmission event using genetic data alone. A new method is presented to calculate a confidence value assessing the likelihood of a transmission event using both phylogenetic inference and limited knowledge of incubation and infectious duration times. The method is applied to simulations of a foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak to demonstrate how the combination of both phylogenetic and epidemiology data can be used to strengthen the assessment of the likelihood of direct transmission over methods using just phylogenetic data or infection timing data alone. The method is applied to a previous FMD outbreak to identify areas where over confidence in previously inferred direct transmission may exist. Combining knowledge from viral evolution and epidemiology within a single integrated transmission inference framework is an important approach to assess the potential likelihood of transmission events and makes clear how specific features of a virus' spread through the course of an outbreak will directly determine the potential for confidence in inferred host transmission links.",2014-11-11,Stephen P Velsko; Jonathan E Allen,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/010389

Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread.",2015-03-27,Eamon B.

Relaxing this assumption can be challenging though, due to the difficulty of acquiring detailed knowledge about the non-random nature of encounters. Here, we fitted a mathematical model of dengue virus transmission to spatial time series data from Pakistan and compared maximum-likelihood estimates of “mixing parameters” when disaggregating data across an urban-rural gradient. We show that dynamics across this gradient are subject not only to differing transmission intensities but also to differing strengths of nonlinearity due to differences in mixing. We furthermore show that neglecting spatial variation in mixing can lead to substantial underestimates of the level of effort needed to control a pathogen with vaccines or other control efforts.

If not properly accounted for, recombination can compromise many evolutionary analyses. In addition, when dealing with organisms that are not obligately sexually reproducing, recombination gives insight into the rate at which distinct genetic lineages come into contact. Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 1106 laboratory-confirmed infections, with 421 MERS-CoV associated deaths as of April 16, 2015. Although bats are considered as the likely ultimate source of zoonotic betacoronaviruses, dromedary camels have been consistently implicated as the source of current human infections in the Middle East. In this paper we use phylogenetic methods and simulations to show that MERS-CoV genome has likely undergone numerous recombinations recently.

When this pattern occurs among amino acid replacements, explanations often invoke an effect of selection, on the grounds that transitions are more conservative in their effects on proteins. However, the underlying hypothesis of conservative transitions has never been tested directly. Here we assess support for this hypothesis using direct evidence: the fitness effects of mutations in actual proteins, measured via individual or paired growth experiments. We assembled data from 8 published studies, ranging in size from 24 to 757 single-nucleotide mutations that change an amino acid. Every study has the statistical power to reveal significant effects of amino acid exchangeability, and most studies have the power to discern a binary conservative-vs-radical distinction. However, only one study suggests that transitions are significantly more conservative than transversions. In the combined set of 1239 replacements, the chance that a transition is more conservative than a transversion is 53 % (95 % confidence interval, 50 % to 56 %), compared to the null expectation of 50 %. We show that this effect is not large compared to that of most biochemical factors, and is not large enough to explain the several-fold bias observed in evolution. In short, available data have the power to verify the ""conservative transitions"" hypothesis if true, but suggest instead that selection on proteins plays at best a minor role in the observed bias.",2015-09-28,Arlin Stoltzfus; Ryan W.

Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or affects a broad array of proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1,300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9,900 proteins conserved across mammals. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins from the cellular functions they hijack and that (ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions.

In this work we present methods to include the effects of domain growth on the evolution of spatial correlations in a continuum approximation of a lattice-based model of cell motility and proliferation. We show that, depending on the way in which domain growth is implemented, different steady-state densities are predicted for an agent population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the way in which domain growth is implemented can result in the evolution of the agent density depending on the size of the domain. Continuum approximations that ignore spatial correlations cannot capture these behaviours, while those that account for spatial correlations do.

Several genotype specific and common codon usage traits were noted in ZIKV coding sequences, indicative of independent evolutionary origins from a common ancestor. The overall influence of natural selection was found to be more profound than that of mutation pressure and acting on specific set of viral genes belonging to ZIKV strains of Asian genotype from the recent outbreak. Furthermore, an interplay of codon adaptation and deoptimization have been observed in ZIKV genomes.

Bacterial and viral datasets were created with even and staggered coverage to evaluate organism identification, read mapping, and gene identification capabilities of available algorithms. These truth datasets are provided as a resource for the development and refinement of metagenomic algorithms. Algorithm performance on these truth datasets can inform decision makers on strengths and weaknesses of available algorithms and how the results may be best leveraged for bacterial and viral organism identification and characterization.Source organisms were selected to mirror communities described in the Human Microbiome Project as well as the emerging pathogens listed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The six in silico datasets were used to evaluate the performance of six leading metagenomics algorithms: MetaScope, Kraken, LMAT, MetaPhlAn, MetaCV, and MetaPhyler.ResultsAlgorithms were evaluated on runtime, true positive organisms identified to the genus and species levels, false positive organisms identified to genus and species level, read mapping, relative abundance estimation, and gene calling. No algorithm out performed the others in all categories, and the algorithm or algorithms of choice strongly depends on analysis goals. MetaPhlAn excels for bacteria and LMAT for viruses.

Motivated in part by these experiments, we performed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the response of a PK over a range of mechanical forces (fs) and monovalent salt concentrations (Cs). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our model. The free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments. By varying f and C, we calculated the phase diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions, populating distinct intermediate states. As f and C are changed, the stem-loop tertiary interactions rupture first, followed by unfolding of the 3’-end hairpin (I⇌F). Finally, the 5’-end hairpin unravels, producing an extended state (E⇌I). A theoretical analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the critical force for rupture scales as (log Cm)α with α = 1 (0.5) for E⇌I (I⇌F) transition. This relation is used to obtain the preferential ion-RNA interaction coefficient, which can be quantitatively measured in single-molecule experiments, as done previously for DNA hairpins.

Although a 5-fold fractional-dose vaccine is similar to standard-dose vaccine in safety and immunogenicity, efficacy is untested. There is an urgent need to ensure the robustness of fractional-dose vaccination by elucidating the conditions under which dose fractionation would reduce transmission.MethodsWe estimate the effective reproductive number for YF in Angola using disease natural history and case report data. With simple mathematical models of YF transmission, we calculate the infection attack rate (IAR, the proportion of population infected over the course of an epidemic) under varying levels of transmissibility and five-fold fractional-dose vaccine efficacy for two vaccination scenarios: (i) random vaccination in a hypothetical population that is completely susceptible; (ii) the Kinshasa vaccination campaign in July-August 2016 with different age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines.FindingsWe estimate the effective reproductive number early in the Angola outbreak was between 5·2 and 7·1. If vaccine action is all-or-nothing (i.e. a proportion VE of vaccinees receives complete and the remainder receive no protection), n-fold fractionation can dramatically reduce IAR as long as efficacy VE exceeds 1/n. This benefit threshold becomes more stringent if vaccine action is leaky (i.e. the susceptibility of each vaccinee is reduced by a factor that is equal to the vaccine efficacy VE). The age cutoff for fractional-dose vaccines chosen by the WHO for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign (namely, 2 years) provides the largest reduction in IAR if the efficacy of five-fold fractional-dose vaccines exceeds 20%.InterpretationDose fractionation is a very effective strategy for reducing infection attack rate that would be robust with a large margin for error in case fractional-dose VE is lower than expected.FundingNIH-MIDAS, HMRF-Hong Kong",2016-05-14,Joseph T.

We tested the hypothesis that increasing virus input titers in polyvalent inactivated HRV vaccine will result in broad nAb responses.

Only three RVA strains have been reported in bats in Kenya (straw-colored fruit bat) and in China (lesser horseshoe and a stoliczka’s trident bat), being highly divergent from each other. To further elucidate the potential of bat RVAs to cause gastroenteritis in humans we started by investigating the genetic diversity of RVAs in fecal samples from 87 straw-colored fruit bats living in close contact with humans in Cameroon using metagenomics. Five samples contained significant numbers of RVA Illumina reads, sufficient to obtain their (near) complete genomes. A single RVA strain showed a close phylogenetic relationship with the Kenyan bat RVA strain in six gene segments, including VP7 (G25), whereas the other gene segments represented novel genotypes as ratified by the RCWG. The 4 other RVA strains were highly divergent from known strains (but very similar among each other) possessing all novel genotypes. Only the VP7 and VP4 genes showed a significant variability representing multiple novel G and P genotypes, indicating the frequent occurrence of reassortment events.Comparing these bat RVA strains with currently used human RVA screening primers indicated that several of the novel VP7 and VP4 segments would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies. Therefore, novel VP6 based screening primers matching both human and bat RVAs were developed and used to screen samples from 25 infants with gastroenteritis living in close proximity with the studied bat population.

Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) act as attachment factors for the virus. In the absence of purified high titer infectious virus, we have used hepatitis E virus-like particles (HEV-LPs) expressed and purified from E. coli to identify HEV entry factor(s) on liver cells in culture. Using a pull down and mass spectrometric approach, we identified the ATP synthase subunit β (ATP5B) to bind the HEV capsid protein. Its role in the entry of HEV was then validated using antibody and siRNA mediated approaches, and infectious HEV from the stools of a hepatitis E patient. Though ATP synthase is largely a mitochondrial protein, the cell surface expressed form of ATP5B is implicated in other viral infections.",2016-06-23,Zulfazal Ahmed; Prasida Holla; Imran Ahmad; Shahid Jameel,,,,False,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/060434

As a result, ZIKV is now a confirmed teratogen. Understanding host-pathogen interactions, specifically cellular perturbations caused by ZIKV, can provide novel therapeutic targets. In order to complete viral replication, viral pathogens control the host cellular machineries and regulate various factors, including long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes, at transcriptional levels. The role of lncRNA genes in the pathogenesis of ZIKV-mediated microcephaly and eye defects is currently unknown. To gain additional insights, we focused on profiling the differentially expressed lncRNA genes during ZIKV infection in mammalian cells. For this study, we employed a contemporary clinical Zika viral isolate, PRVABC59, of Asian genotype. We utilized an unbiased RNA sequencing approach to profile the lncRNA transcriptome in ZIKV infected Vero cells. We identified a total of 121 lncRNA genes that are differentially regulated at 48 hours post-infection. The majority of these genes are independently validated by reverse-transcription qPCR. A notable observation was that the lncRNAs, MALAT1 (Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1) and NEAT1 (Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly Transcript 1), are down-regulated upon Zika viral infection. MALAT1 and NEAT1 are known as nuclear localized RNAs that regulate gene expression and cell proliferation. Protein-lncRNA interaction maps revealed that MALAT1 and NEAT1 share common interacting partners and form a larger network comprising of 71 cellular factors. ZIKV-mediated dysregulation of these two regulatory lncRNAs can alter the expression of respective target genes and associated biological functions, an important one being cell division. In conclusion, this investigation is the first to provide insight into the biological connection of lncRNAs and ZIKV which can be further explored for developing antiviral therapy and understanding fetal developmental processes.",2016-07-01,Arunachalam Ramaiah; Deisy Contreras; Vineela Gangalapudi; Masumi Sameer Padhye; Jie Tang; Vaithilingaraja Arumugaswami,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/061788

In order to explore their functional interaction, we engineered previously stable single-polypeptide-chain (sc) A2AR/D2LR: whether the molecular entity of the striatal A2AR/D2R antagonism, i.e., scA2AR/D2Rs are just A2AR/D2R with the antagonism, remains unresolved.New MethodTo further clarify the heteromerization through the scA2AR/D2LR, we here designed supramolecularly ‘exclusive’ monomers and dimers, using the Cε2 domain of IgE-Fc or apoproteins of the bacterial light-harvesting antenna complex.ResultsA concept of the recptor protein assembly regulation, i.e., the selective monomer/non-obligate dimer formation was obtained. Although none of these new fusions were constructed or tested, we could aim at obtaining heterodimer-specific agents, using the scA2AR/D2R. Whether the resulting designs were explained feasibly and rationally was addressed. The structure and function of the non-obligate dimer were here discussed through scA2AR/D2R, focusing on the procedure of the membrane protein design and methods for transient protein-protein interactions.Summary and OutlookGiven that upon being expressed and allosteric regulation occurs regardless of specific signal to non-specific noise (S/N) ratio, the supramolecular designs, allowing us to express selectively monomer/non-obligate dimer of class A GPCR, are experimentally testable and will be used to confirm in vivo that such low S/N ratio interaction between A2AR and D2LR functions in the dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum.Abbreviations:A2ARadenosine A2A receptor3HA-A2ARA2AR tagged with a triple HA epitopeBchlbacteriochlorophyllBRETbioluminescence resonance energy transferCcarboxy-terminalCDcluster of differentiationD2LR and D2SRthe long and short form of dopamine D2 receptor, respectivelyFabantigen binding fragmentFcFc fragmentFcεRIhigh affinity receptor for IgEFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferG4San amino acid sequence consisting of a four-glycine-repeat followed by a serine residueGABAγ-aminobutyric acidGABABGABA type B receptorGPCRG protein-coupled receptorGttransducinHAhemagglutininHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusICintracellular loopsIgimmunoglobulinLHlight-harvesting antenna complexmAbmonoclonal antibodyMrmolecular weightNamino-terminalPDParkinson’s diseasePSphotosystemRCreaction centerRlucRenilla luciferasescsingle-chainTMtransmembrane3Dthree-dimensional",2016-07-26,Toshio Kamiya; Takashi Masuko; Dasiel Oscar Borroto-Escuela; Haruo Okado; Hiroyasu Nakata,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/065250

We analysed the immunity related genes of Parhyale as an important comparative system for these species, where immunity related aquaculture problems have increased as farming has intensified. We also find that Parhyale and other species within Multicrustacea contain the enzyme sets necessary to perform lignocellulose digestion (“wood eating”), suggesting this ability may predate the diversification of this lineage.

Our knowledge of genome composition, needed for downstream inferences, is critically dependent on gene annotations, yet problems associated with gene annotation and assembly errors are usually ignored in comparative genomics. Here we analyze the genomes of 68 species across 12 animal phyla and some single-cell eukaryotes for general trends in genome composition and transcription, taking into account problems of gene annotation. We show that, regardless of genome size, the ratio of introns to intergenic sequence is comparable across essentially all animals, with nearly all deviations dominated by increased intergenic sequence. Genomes of model organisms have ratios much closer to 1:1, suggesting that the majority of published genomes of non-model organisms are underannotated and consequently omit substantial numbers of genes, with likely negative impact on evolutionary interpretations. Finally, our results also indicate that most animals transcribe half or more of their genomes arguing against differences in genome usage between animal groups, and also suggesting that the transcribed portion is more dependent on genome size than previously thought.",2016-08-09,Warren R.

There is limited understanding of how the time in the future over which individuals make a behavioral decision, their planning horizon, affects epidemic dynamics. We developed an agent-based model (along with an ODE analog) to explore the decision-making of self-interested individuals on adopting prophylactic behavior. The decision-making process incorporates prophylaxis efficacy and disease prevalence with individuals' payoffs and planning horizon. Our results show that for short and long planning horizons individuals do not consider engaging in prophylactic behavior. In contrast, individuals adopt prophylactic behavior when considering intermediate planning horizons. Such adoption, however, is not always monotonically associated with the prevalence of the disease, depending on the perceived protection efficacy and the disease parameters. Adoption of prophylactic behavior reduces the peak size while prolonging the epidemic and potentially generates secondary waves of infection. These effects can be made stronger by increasing the behavioral decision frequency or distorting an individual’s perceived risk of infection.",2016-08-12,Luis G. Nardin; Craig R. Miller; Benjamin J.

Because viral RNAs often lack canonical caps or poly-A tails, they can also be vulnerable to degradation by these host exonucleases. Yeast lack sophisticated mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, but do use RNA degradation as an antiviral defense mechanism. One model is that the RNA of yeast viruses is subject to degradation simply as a side effect of the intrinsic exonuclease activity of proteins involved in RNA metabolism. Contrary to this model, we find a highly refined, species-specific relationship between Xrn1p and the “L-A” totiviruses of different Saccharomyces yeast species. We show that the gene XRN1 has evolved rapidly under positive natural selection in Saccharomyces yeast, resulting in high levels of Xrn1p protein sequence divergence from one yeast species to the next. We also show that these sequence differences translate to differential interactions with the L-A virus, where Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae is most efficient at controlling the L-A virus that chronically infects S. cerevisiae, and Xrn1p from S. kudriavzevii is most efficient at controlling the L-A-like virus that we have discovered within S. kudriavzevii. All Xrn1p orthologs are equivalent in their interaction with another virus-like parasite, the Ty1 retrotransposon. Thus, the activity of Xrn1p against totiviruses is not simply an incidental consequence of the enzymatic activity of Xrn1p, but rather Xrn1p co-evolves with totiviruses to maintain its potent antiviral activity and limit viral propagation in Saccharomyces yeasts. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that Xrn1p physically interacts with the Gag protein encoded by the L-A virus, suggesting a host-virus interaction that is more complicated than just Xrn1p-mediated nucleolytic digestion of viral RNAs.",2016-08-16,Paul A.

In 2015, ZIKV triggered a large epidemic in Brazil and spread across Latin America. In November of that year, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of neonatal microcephaly, which corresponds geographically and temporally to the ZIKV outbreak. ZIKV was isolated from the brain tissue of a fetus diagnosed with microcephaly, and recent studies in mice models revealed that ZIKV infection may cause brain defects by influencing brain cell developments. Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which ZIKV alters neurophysiological development remain unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional gene expression by translational repression. In order to gain insight into the possible role of ZIKV-mediated miRNA signaling dysfunction in brain-tissue development, we computationally predicted new miRNAs encoded by the ZIKV genome and their effective hybridization with transcripts from human genes previously shown to be involved in microcephalia. The results of these studies suggest a possible role of these miRNAs on the expression of human genes associated with this disease. Besides, a new ZIKV miRNA was predicted in the 3’stem loop (3’ SL) of the 3’untranslated region (3’UTR) of the ZIKV genome, suggesting the role of the 3’UTR of flaviviruses as a source of miRNAs.",2016-08-21,Juan Cristina; Natalia Echeverría; Fabiana Gambaro; Alvaro Fajardo; Pilar Moreno,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/070656

The success of these non-pharmaceutical strategies will depend not only on the effectiveness of quarantine or other isolation measures but also on the epidemiological characteristics of the infection. However, there is currently no systematic framework to assess the relationship between different containment strategies and the natural history and epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Here, we compare the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, implemented via contact tracing, in controlling epidemics using an agent-based branching model. We examine the relationship between epidemic containment and the disease dynamics of symptoms and infectiousness for seven case study diseases with diverse natural histories including Ebola, Influenza A, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). We show that the comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring and quarantine depends critically on the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. The benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is generally maximized for fast-course diseases, but we show the conditions under which symptom monitoring alone can control certain outbreaks. This quantitative framework can guide policy-makers on how best to use non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain emerging outbreaks and prioritize research during an outbreak of a novel pathogen.SIGNIFICANCEQuarantine and symptom monitoring of contacts with suspected exposure to an infectious disease are key interventions for the control of emerging epidemics; however, there does not yet exist a quantitative framework for comparing the control performance of each.

kxe65hd7,,biorxiv,Zika virus infection as a cause of congenital brain abnormalities and Guillain-Barré syndrome: systematic review,10.1101/073098,,,biorxiv,"AbstractBackgroundThe World Health Organization stated in March 2016 that there was scientific consensus that the mosquito-borne Zika virus was a cause of the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré syndrome and of microcephaly and other congenital brain abnormalities, based on rapid evidence assessments. Decisions about causality require systematic assessment to guide public health actions. The objectives of this study were: to update and re-assess the evidence for causality through a rapid and systematic review about links between Zika virus infection and a) congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the foetuses and offspring of pregnant women and b) Guillain-Barré syndrome in any population; and to describe the process and outcomes of an expert assessment of the evidence about causality.Methods and findingsThe study had three linked components. First, in February 2016, we developed a causality framework that defined questions about the relationship between Zika virus infection and each of the two clinical outcomes in 10 dimensions; temporality, biological plausibility, strength of association, alternative explanations, cessation, dose-response, animal experiments, analogy, specificity and consistency. Second, we did a systematic review (protocol number CRD42016036693). We searched multiple online sources up to May 30, 2016 to find studies that directly addressed either outcome and any causality dimension, used methods to expedite study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, and summarised evidence descriptively. Third, a multidisciplinary panel of experts assessed the review findings and reached consensus on causality. We found 1091 unique items up to May 30, 2016. For congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, we included 72 items; for eight of 10 causality dimensions (all except dose-response relationship and specificity) we found that more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association with Zika virus infection. For Guillain-Barré syndrome, we included 36 items, of which more than half the relevant studies supported a causal association in seven of ten dimensions (all except dose-response relationship, specificity and animal experimental evidence). Articles identified non-systematically from May 30-July 29, 2016 strengthened the review findings. The expert panel concluded that: a) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and clusters of microcephaly is that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities including 61 microcephaly; and b) the most likely explanation of available evidence from outbreaks of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome is that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The expert panel recognised that Zika virus alone may not be sufficient to cause either congenital brain abnormalities or Guillain-Barré syndrome but agreed that the evidence was sufficient to recommend increased public health measures. Weaknesses are the limited assessment of the role of dengue virus and other possible co-factors, the small number of comparative epidemiological studies, and the difficulty in keeping the review up to date with the pace of publication of new research.ConclusionsRapid and systematic reviews with frequent updating and open dissemination are now needed, both for appraisal of the evidence about Zika virus infection and for the next public health threats that will emerge. This rapid systematic review found sufficient evidence to say that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of Guillain-Barré situation.",2016-09-02,Fabienne Krauer; Maurane Riesen; Ludovic Reveiz; Olufemi T Oladapo; Ruth Martínez-Vega; Teegwendé V.

It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world population will be infected by Zika, but unfortunately no vaccine or medicine is available so far. Zika NS2B-NS3pro is essential for its replication and thus represents an attractive target for drug discovery/design. Here we characterized conformation, catalysis, inhibition and dynamics of linked and unlinked Zika NS2B-NS3pro complexes by both experiments and MD simulations. The results unveil the unique properties of Zika NS2B-NS3pro which are very different from Dengue one. Particularly, CD and NMR studies indicate that unlike Dengue, the C-terminal region of Zika NS2B with a significant sequence variation is highly disordered in the open conformation. Indeed, MD simulations reveal that up to 100 ns, the Dengue NS2B C-terminus constantly has close contacts with its NS3pro domain. By a sharp contrast, the Zika NS2B C-terminus loses the contacts with its NS3pro domain after 10 ns, further forming a short β-sheet characteristic of the closed conformation at 30 ns. Furthermore, we found that a small molecule, previously identified as an active site inhibitor for other flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro, inhibited Zika NS2B-NS3pro potently in an allosteric manner.

As the two inhibitors fundamentally differ from cn-716, the only known peptidomimetic boronic acid inhibitor in both structure scaffolds and inhibitory modes, our discovery might open up a new avenue for the future development of allosteric inhibitors, which is highly demanded to achieve therapeutic inhibition of flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complexes.

We have analyzed the impact of positive selection on the evolution of these variants using complete genome coding regions, and compared the levels of genetic variability and the distribution of positively selected sites. We have also compared the distributions of positively selected and conserved sites considering different factors such as RNA secondary structure, the presence of different epitopes (antibody, CD4 and CD8), and secondary protein structure. Less than 10% of the genome was found to be under positive selection, and purifying selection was the main evolutionary force in both subtypes. We found differences in the number of positively selected sites between subtypes in several genes (Core, HVR2 in E2, P7, helicase in NS3 and NS4a). Heterozygosity values in positively selected sites and the rate of non-synonymous substitutions were significantly higher in subtype HCV-1b. Logistic regression analyses revealed that similar selective forces act at the genome level in both subtypes: RNA secondary structure and CD4 T-cell epitopes are associated with conservation, while CD8 T-cell epitopes are associated with positive selection in both subtypes.

Herein, we improved the widely used Z curve method by creating a λ-interval Z curve, which considered interval association information. With this method and recursive feature elimination technology, a computational model was developed to predict human gene essentiality. The 5-fold cross-validation test based on our benchmark dataset obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.8814. For the rigorous jackknife test, the AUC score was 0.8854. These results demonstrated that the essentiality of human genes could be reliably reflected by only sequence information. However, previous classifiers in three eukaryotes can gave satisfactory prediction only combining sequence with other features. It is also demonstrated that although the information contributed by interval association is less than adjacent nucleotides, this information can still play an independent role. Integrating the interval information into adjacent ones can significantly improve our classifier’s prediction capacity. We re-predicted the benchmark negative dataset by Pheg server (https://cefg.uestc.edu.cn/Pheg), and 118 genes were additionally predicted as essential.

It is believed that some of them may even contribute to the development of cancer. The present work is dedicated to the identification of mycoplasmas in patients with breast cancer. Mycoplasmas may participate in the development of several human diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, atypical pneumonia, etc. Moreover, there is a reason to believe that mycoplasma can participate in the development of cancer, leukemia and lymphoma. DNA samples from blood, saliva and tumor tissues of the Oncology Institute of Moldova patients diagnosed with breast cancer were analyzed. Mycoplasma testing was performed using nested PCR method. For Mycoplasma spp. detection, we used primers from the region of the 16S-23S RNA genes. The identification of Mycoplasma faucium, Mycoplasma salivarium and Mycoplasma orale was performed by nested PCR with primers for RNA polymerase beta subunit gene corresponding to mycoplasma. M.faucium and M.salivarius was found in saliva at about 100%, and M.orale at a frequency of about 50%. Only M.faucium was found with the frequency of about 60% in the tissue of the patients. Moreover, a fairly high rate of detection of mycoplasma is observed both in the cases when primers for RNA polymerase gene and primers for 16S-23S RNA were used. We found M.faucium in tumor tissues of patients diagnosed with breast cancer. It is known that mycoplasmas are able to stimulate the synthesis of certain cytokines, which act as mitogenes on the cell. We assume that M.faucium can stimulate the mitogenes synthesis in breast tissues (e.g., cytokines) which, in turn, stimulate cell division and thus participate in the initiation of breast cancer.",2016-11-22,Valentin Mitin; Lidia Tumanova; Natalia Botnariuc,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/089128

Disease prevention and treatment is dependent on our understanding of the shared and unique responses elicited by diverse viruses, yet few studies compare host responses to different viruses while controlling other experimental parameters. We compared changes in gene expression of murine lung epithelial cells infected individually by three respiratory viruses causing mild (rhinovirus, RV1B), moderate (coronavirus, MHV-1), and severe (influenza A virus, PR8) disease in mice. RV1B infection caused numerous gene expression changes, but the differential effect peaked at 12 hours post-infection. PR8 altered an intermediate number of genes whose expression continued to change through 24 hours. MHV-1 had comparatively few effects on host gene expression. The viruses elicited highly overlapping responses in antiviral genes, though MHV-1 induced a lower type I interferon response than the other two viruses. Signature genes were identified for each virus and included host defense genes for PR8, tissue remodeling genes for RV1B, and transcription factors for MHV-1.

Carriage of bacterial and viral species was shown to vary with participant age, recent RTI and the presence of other species. The spatial structure of microbial respiratory communities was less nested (more disordered) in the young (0-4 years) and those with recent RTI. Species frequency distributions were flatter than random expectation in young individuals (X2 = 20.42, p = 0.002), indicating spatial clumping of species consistent with facilitative relationships amongst them. Deviations from a neutral model of ecological niches were observed for samples collected in the summer and from older individuals (those aged 5-17, 18-64 and ≥65 years) but not in samples collected from winter, younger individuals (those aged 0-4 years), individuals with recent RTI and individuals without recent RTI, demonstrating the importance of both neutral and niche processes in respiratory community assembly.

Results were compared against conventional microbiologic assays.MEASUREMENTS & MAIN RESULTSmNGS demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detecting respiratory microbes (human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, human herpesvirus 6 and cytomegalovirus) when compared to standard testing. Previously unrecognized LRTI pathogens were identified in six patients for whom standard testing was negative (human coronavirus 229E, human rhinovirus A, Corynebacterium propinquum and Streptococcus mitis); findings were confirmed by independent PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing.

For Influenza A virus (IAV) such a glycoprotein receptor has not been described, to date. Here we show that IAV is using the host membrane glycoprotein CD66c as a receptor for entry into human epithelial lung cells. Neuraminidase (NA), a viral spike protein binds to CD66c on the cell surface during IAV entry into the host cells. Lung cells overexpressing CD66c showed an increase in virus binding and subsequent entry into the cell. Upon comparison, CD66c demonstrated higher binding capacity than other membrane glycoproteins (EGFR and DC-SIGN) reported earlier to facilitate IAV entry into host cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of CD66c from lung cells inhibited virus binding on cell surface and entry into cells. Blocking CD66c by antibody on the cell surface resulted in decreased virus entry. We found CD66c is a specific glycoprotein receptor for influenza A virus that did not affect entry of non-IAV RNA virus (Hepatitis C virus). Finally, IAV pre-incubated with recombinant CD66c protein when administered intranasally in mice showed decreased cytopathic effects in mice lungs. This publication is the first to report CD66c (CEACAM6) as a glycoprotein receptor for Influenza A virus.Significance StatementCells are enclosed by a semipermeable membrane that allows selective exchange of biomolecules between cells and their surroundings. A set of specialized proteins in this semipermeable membrane, work like gatekeepers to the cell and regulate entry of these biomolecules. One class of such surface proteins is termed as receptors. Viruses bind to one or more of these receptors and manipulate gatekeepers for their own successful entry into host-cells. A membrane protein that influenza A virus (Flu virus) uses for entry into the cells was not discovered till date.

It is well known that Bcl-2 exerts its tumor promoting function through the mitochondrial pathway. However, the mechanism by which Bcl-2 suppresses tumor formation is not well understood. We have previously shown that Bcl-2 inhibits cell cycle progression from the G0/G1 to the S phase after serum starvation, and that quiescent Bcl-2 expressing cells maintained a significant lower level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the control cells. Based on the fact that ROS mediate cell cycle progression, and are controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), a key molecule induced by prolonged starvation and involved in mitochondrial metabolism, we hypothesized that PGC-1α might be related with the cell cycle function of Bcl-2. Here, we showed that PGC-1α was upregulated upon Bcl-2 overexpression and downregulated following Bcl-2 knockdown during serum starvation. Knockdown of PGC-1α activated Bcl-2 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that after serum depletion, PGC-la might coordinate with Bcl-2 to reduce ROS, which in turn delay cell cycle progression.Summary statementPGC-1α coordinate with Bcl-2 delay cell cycle progression to reduce ROS after serum depletion in human glioma U251 cells.",2017-02-24,Kun Yao; Xufeng Fu; Du Xing; Yan Li; Bing Han; Chen Zexi; Shanshan Yang; Ran Wei; Jiaqi Zhou; Qinghua Cui,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/111567

Here, we report a high-resolution map of ribosomal occupancy of the Zika virus genome during infection of mammalian and insect cells, obtained by ribosome profiling. In contrast to some other flaviviruses such as West Nile, we find no evidence for substantial frameshift-induced ribosomal drop-off during translation of the viral polyprotein, indicating that Zika virus must use alternative mechanisms to downregulate levels of catalytically active viral polymerase. We also show that high levels of ribosome-protected fragments map in-frame to two previously overlooked upstream open reading frames (uORFs) initiating at CUG and UUG codons, with likely consequences for the efficiency of polyprotein expression. Curiously, in African isolates of Zika virus, the two uORFs are fused in-frame into a single uORF.

We have used this algorithm to identify 36,488 prophage regions from 11,941 bacterial genomes, including almost 600 prophages with no known homology to any proteins. Transfer RNA genes were abundant in the prophages, many of which alleviate the limits of translation efficiency due to host codon bias and presumably enable phages to surpass the normal capacity of the hosts’ translation machinery. We identified integrase genes in 15,765 prophages (43% of the prophages).

By targeting multiple synergistic ageing pathways, we are able to slow ageing rate, double lifespan and improves healthspan while minimize developmental and fitness trade-offs. Moreover, we established that there is no synergistic benefit in a daf-2 or daf-7 background, implying the involvement of the TGFβ and IGF pathways in this synergy.

To infer when during animal evolution signaling pathways became associated with cilia, we characterized the proteomes of cilia from three organisms: sea urchins, sea anemones and choanoflagellates. From these ciliomes, we identified 437 high confidence ciliary candidate proteins conserved in mammals, including known regulators of Hh, GPCR and TRP channel signaling. The phylogenetic profiles of their ciliary association indicate that the Hh and GPCR pathways were linked to cilia before the origin of bilateria and TRP channels before the origin of animals. We demonstrated that some of the candidates not previously implicated in ciliary biology localized to cilia and further investigated ENKUR, a TRP channel-interacting protein that we identified in the cilia of all three organisms. In animals, ENKUR is expressed by cells with motile cilia, ENKUR localizes to cilia in diverse organisms and, in both Xenopus laevis and mice, ENKUR is required for patterning the left/right axis. Moreover, mutation of ENKUR causes situs inversus in humans.

Identifying such interactions can potentially be achieved through genetic association studies. However, extensive and correlated genetic population structure in hosts and pathogens presents a substantial risk of confounding analyses. Moreover, the multiple testing burden of interaction scanning can potentially limit power. To address these problems, we have developed a Bayesian approach for detecting host influences on pathogen evolution that makes use of vast existing data sets of pathogen diversity to improve power and control for stratification. The approach models key processes, including recombination and selection, and identifies regions of the pathogen genome affected by host factors. Using simulations and empirical analysis of drug-induced selection on the HIV-1 genome we demonstrate the power of the method to recover known associations and show greatly improved precision-recall characteristics compared to other approaches.

However, select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding interleukin-6 (IL-6), escape SOX-induced cleavage. IL-6 escape is mediated through a 3’ UTR RNA regulatory element that overrides the SOX targeting mechanism. Here, we reveal that this protective RNA element functions to broadly restrict cleavage by a range of homologous and non-homologous viral endonucleases. However, it does not impede cleavage by cellular endonucleases. The IL-6 protective sequence may be representative of a larger class of nuclease escape elements, as we identified a similar protective element in the GADD45B mRNA. The IL-6 and GADD45B-derived elements display similarities in their sequence, putative structure, and several associated RNA binding proteins. However, the overall composition of their ribonucleoprotein complexes appears distinct, leading to differences in the breadth of nucleases restricted. These findings highlight how RNA elements can selectively control transcript abundance in the background of widespread virus-induced mRNA degradation.AUTHOR SUMMARYThe ability of viruses to control the host gene expression environment is crucial to promote viral infection. Many viruses express factors that reduce host gene expression through widespread mRNA decay. However, some mRNAs escape this fate, like the transcript encoding the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-6 during KSHV infection. IL-6 escape relies on an RNA regulatory element located in its 3’UTR and involves the recruitment of a protective protein complex. Here, we show that this escape extends beyond KSHV to a variety of related and unrelated viral endonucleases. However, the IL-6 element does not protect against cellular endonucleases, revealing for the first time a virus-specific nuclease escape element. We identified a related escape element in the GADD45B mRNA, which displays several similarities with the IL-6 element. However, these elements assemble a largely distinct complex of proteins, leading to differences in the breadth of their protective capacity. Collectively, these findings reveal how a putative new class of RNA elements function to control RNA fate in the background of widespread mRNA degradation by viral endonucleases.",2017-06-26,Mandy Muller; Britt A.

Guidance issued by CDC on active monitoring was a cornerstone of its response to the West Africa Ebola outbreak. There are limited data on how to balance the costs and performance of this important public health activity. We present a framework that estimates the risks and costs of specific durations of active monitoring for pathogens of significant public health concern. We analyze data from New York City’s Ebola active monitoring program over a 16-month period in 2014-2016. For monitored individuals, we identified unique durations of active monitoring that minimize expected costs for those at “low (but not zero) risk” and “some or high risk”: 21 and 31 days, respectively. Extending our analysis to smallpox and MERS-CoV, we found that the optimal length of active monitoring relative to the median incubation period was reduced compared to Ebola due to less variable incubation periods. Active monitoring can save lives but is expensive. Resources can be most effectively allocated by using exposure-risk categories to modify the duration or intensity of active monitoring.",2017-06-28,Nicholas G Reich; Justin Lessler; Jay K Varma; Neil M Vora,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/156497

This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSV-infected cells.

Whether this viral resistance is due to a unique innate immune system is unknown. An evolutionarily conserved feature of vertebrate antiviral immunity is the interferon (IFN) response, which triggers cellular defenses through interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. While bats encode an intact IFN system, global ISG expression patterns in bat cells are not well characterized. Here, we used RNA-Seq to assess the transcriptional response to IFNα in cells derived from the bat Pteropus alecto (black flying fox). We show induction of more than 100 transcripts, most of which are canonical ISGs observed in other species. Kinetic gene profiling revealed that P. alecto ISGs fall into two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines. In contrast to bat ISGs, human ISGs generally remained elevated for longer periods following IFN treatment, suggesting host-based differences in gene regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we also identified a small group of non-canonical bat ISGs, including an enzymatically active RNASEL that plays a role in controlling viral infection. These studies provide insight into the innate immune response of an important viral reservoir and lay a foundation for studies into the immunological features that may underlie unique virus-host relationship in bats.Significance StatementBats are considered unique in their ability to resist disease caused by viruses that are often pathogenic in humans. While the nature of this viral resistance is unknown, genomic data suggest bat innate immune systems may be specialized in controlling these disease-causing viruses. A critical cell intrinsic antiviral defense system in vertebrates is the interferon response, which suppresses viral infection through induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we report the repertoire of ISGs and several unique features of ISG induction kinetics in bat cells. We also characterize induction and antiviral activity of bat RNASEL, which is induced by IFN in bat, but not human cells.

In this study, we focus on the highly conserved nonstructural protein (NSP) 16, a viral 2’O methyl-transferase (MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif in the conserved KDKE motif of MERS NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2’O MTase activity had only marginal impact on propagation and replication in Vero cells, the MERS dNSP16 mutant demonstrated significant attenuation relative to control both in primary human airway cultures and in vivo. Further examination indicated the MERS dNSP16 mutant had a type I IFN based attenuation and was partially restored in the absence of IFIT molecules. Importantly, the robust attenuation permitted use of MERS dNSP16 as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from challenge with a mouse adapted MERS-CoV strain. These studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2’O MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting.SignificanceCoronavirus emergence in both human and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health, as evidenced by the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, PEDV and swine delta coronavirus in the 21st century.

CoVs encode a proofreading 3′→5′exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity.IMPORTANCEUnique among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are either non-viable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we show that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt over long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogs that is only partially explained by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogs is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.",2017-08-11,Kevin W.

This study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of persistent bacterial bronchitis.Blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with persistent bacterial bronchitis, with an additional directed sample obtained from persistent bacterial bronchitis patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community composition (R2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture.The bacteria present in the lungs of patients with persistent bacterial bronchitis were less diverse in terms of richness and evenness.

CoVs encode several innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-β) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication did not result in IFN-β gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-β-mediated antiviral state, ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated. However, ExoN(-) virus generated from IFN-β pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest MHV ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity.",2017-08-29,James Brett Case; Yize Li; Ruth Elliott; Xiaotao Lu; Kevin W.

The majority of such events occurred in parallel to cross-species transmission events and varied between HIV-1 groups, indicating independent adaptation strategies. The evolutionary rate decelerations we found were particularly prominent in accessory proteins that counteract host antiviral restriction factors, suggesting that these factors are a major barrier to viral adaptation to a new host. Surprisingly, we observed that the non-pandemic HIV-1 group O, derived from gorillas, exhibited more rate deceleration events than the pandemic group M, derived from chimpanzees.

Almost nothing is known about its RNA-related roles in cell biology. Furthermore, its RNA-binding domain has not been characterized. Here, we reveal that RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain, which we postulate to be a novel RNA-binding domain. Using CLIP-seq and SILAC-based co-immunoprecipitation assays, we uncover TRIM25’s endogenous RNA targets and protein binding partners. Finally, we show that the RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is important for its ubiquitin ligase function.

Codon-optimization of proviral DNA rescues viral translation, implying that IFITM-mediated restriction requires recognition of viral RNA elements. In addition, we find that expression of the viral accessory protein Nef can help overcome the IFITM-mediated inhibition of virus production.

However, substantial ecological diversity, both in virulence level and host range, is known within virus species. Here we demonstrate a proof of concept for easily discovering ecological diversity within a virus species taxon. We have focused on the West Nile Virus to take advantage of its broad host range in nature. We produced a genome-based phylogeny of world diversity of WNV and then used Ecotype Simulation 2 to hypothesize demarcation of genomes into 69 putative ecotypes (ecologically distinct populations), based only on clustering of genome sequences. Then we looked for evidence of ecological divergence among ecotypes based on differences in host bird associations within the Connecticut-New York region. Our results indicated significant heterogeneity among ecotypes for their associations with different bird hosts. Ecological diversity within other zoonotic viruses could be easily discovered using this approach.

Many of these molecules comprise regions with varying structural properties including disorder, flexibility, and partial occupancy. These traits make computational 3D reconstruction from 2D images challenging. Detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs, used to keep membrane proteins in solution, are common examples of locally disordered structures that can negatively affect existing iterative refinement algorithms which assume rigidity (or spatial uniformity). We introduce a cross-validation approach to derive non-uniform refinement, an algorithm that automatically regularizes 3D density maps during iterative refinement to account for spatial variability, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality. We find that in common iterative refinement methods, regularization using spatially uniform filtering operations can simultaneously over- and under-regularize local regions of a 3D map. In contrast, non-uniform refinement removes noise in disordered regions while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images. Our results include state-of-the-art resolution 3D reconstructions of multiple membrane proteins with molecular weight as low as 90kDa. These results demonstrate that higher resolutions and improved 3D density map quality can be achieved even for small membrane proteins, an important use case for single particle cryo-EM, both in structural biology and drug discovery.

Targeted detection methods have a limited ability to detect unknown viruses and often provide insufficient data to detect coinfections or identify antigenic variants. Random, deep sequencing is a method that can more fully detect and characterize RNA viruses and is often coupled with molecular techniques or culture methods for viral enrichment. Viral culture coupled with third-generation sequencing were tested for the ability to detect and characterize RNA viruses. Cultures of bovine viral diarrhea virus, canine distemper virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, two influenza A viruses, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus were sequenced on the MinION platform using a random, reverse primer in a strand-switching reaction, coupled with PCR-based barcoding. Reads were taxonomically classified and used for reference-based sequence building using a stock personal computer. This method accurately detected and identified complete coding sequence genomes with a minimum of 20× coverage depth for all seven viruses, including a sample containing two viruses. Each lineage-typing region had at least 26× coverage depth for all viruses. Furthermore, analyzing the canine distemper virus sample through a pipeline devoid of canine distemper virus reference sequences modeled the ability of this protocol to detect unknown viruses.

In such models, it is essential to account for as many sources of uncertainty -- natural, or otherwise -- to ensure robustness in prediction and to accurately depict variation around an expected outcome. In this paper, we investigate how well the standard deterministic models match the predictions made using individual-based stochastic simulations. We also explore how well concepts which derive from deterministic models, such as ‘breakpoints’ in transmission, apply in the stochastic world. Employing an individual based stochastic model framework we also investigate how transmission and control are affected by the migration of infected people into a defined community. To give our study focus we consider the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) by mass drug administration (MDA), though our methodology is readily applicable to the other helminth species such as the schistosome parasites and the filarial worms. We show it is possible to define a ‘stochastic breakpoint’ where much noise surrounds the expected deterministic breakpoint. We also discuss the concept of the ‘interruption of transmission’ independent of the ‘breakpoint’ concept where analyses of model behaviour illustrate the current limitations of deterministic models to account for the ‘fade-out’ or transmission extinction behaviour in simulations. The analyses based on migration confirm a relationship between the infected human migration rate per unit of time and the death rate of infective stages that are released into the free-living environment (eggs or larvae depending on the STH species) that create the reservoir of infection which in turn determines the likelihood that control activities aim at chemotherapeutic treatment of the human host will eliminate transmission.

The transcriptome of virus-infected M. restricta cells was compared to that of virus-free cells, and the results showed that transcripts involved in ribosomal biosynthesis were down regulated and those involved in energy production and programmed cell death were increased in abundance. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly larger vacuoles for virus-infected M. restricta cells, indicating that MrV40 infection dramatically altered M. restricta physiology.

Since its first outbreak in 2012, the virus has repeatedly transmitted from camels to humans with 2,468 confirmed cases, causing 851 deaths. To date, there are no efficacious drugs and vaccines against MERS-CoV, increasing its potential to cause a public health emergency. A critical step in the life cycle of MERS-CoV is the fusion with the host cell with its spike (S) protein as main determinant of viral entry. Proteolytic cleavage of S exposes its fusion peptide (FP), which initiates membrane fusion. Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudo-particles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca2+, as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.",2019-12-19,Marco R.

Prominently, various versions of the so-called gravity model, borrowed from transportation theory, have been used. However, the original literature suggests that the model has some potential misspecifications inasmuch as it fails to capture higher-order interactions among population centers. The fields of economics, geography and network sciences holds alternative formulations for the spatial coupling within and among conurbations. These includes Stouffer’s rank model, Fotheringham’s competing destinations model and the radiation model of Simini et al. Since the spread of infectious disease reflects mobility through the filter of age-specific susceptibility and infectivity and since, moreover, disease may alter spatial behavior, it is essential to confront with epidemiological data on spread. To study their relative merit we, accordingly, fit variants of these models to the uniquely detailed dataset of prevaccination measles in the 954 cities and towns of England and Wales over the years 1944-65 and compare them using a consistent likelihood framework. We find that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, both Stouffer’s rank model, an extended version of the radiation model and the Fotheringham competing destinations model provide significantly better fits, Stouffer’s model being the best. Through a new method of spatially disaggregated likelihoods we identify areas of relatively poorer fit, and show that it is indeed in densely-populated conurbations that higher order spatial interactions are most important. Our main conclusion is that it is premature to narrow in on a single class of models for predicting spatial spread of infectious disease. The supplemental materials contain all code for reproducing the results and applying the methods to other data sets.Author summaryThe ability to predict how infectious disease will spread is of great importance in the face of the numerous emergent and re-emergent pathogens that currently threatening human well-being. We identified a variety of alternative models that predict human mobility as as a function of population distribution across a landscape. These consider some models that account for pair-wise interactions between population centers, as well as some that allow for higher-order interactions. We trained the models using a uniquely rich spatiotemporal data set on pre-vaccination measles in England and wales (1944-65), which comprises more than a million records from 954 cities and towns. Likelihood rankings of the different models reveal strong evidence for higher-order interactions in the form of competition among cities as destinations for travelers and, thus, dilution of spatial transmission.

While previous studies showed that L. donovani reprograms transcription to subvert host cell functions, it remains unclear whether the parasite also alters host mRNA translation to establish a successful infection. To assess this, we compared transcriptome-wide translation in primary mouse macrophages infected with L. donovani promastigotes or amastigotes using polysome-profiling. This identified ample selective changes in translation (3,127 transcripts) which were predicted to target central cellular functions by inducing synthesis of proteins related to chromatin remodeling and RNA metabolism while inhibiting those related to intracellular trafficking and antigen presentation. Parallel quantification of protein and mRNA levels for a set of transcripts whose translation was activated upon L. donovani infection (Papbpc1, Eif2ak2, and Tgfb) confirmed, as indicated by polysome-profiling, increased protein levels despite largely unaltered mRNA levels. Mechanistic in silico analyses suggested activated translation depending on the kinase mTOR (e.g. Pabpc1) and the RNA helicase eIF4A (e.g. Tgfb) during infection. Accordingly, treatment with mTOR inhibitors torin-1 or rapamycin reversed L. donovani-induced PABPC1 without affecting corresponding transcript levels. Similarly, the production of TGF-β decreased in presence of the eIF4A inhibitor silvestrol despite unaltered Tgfb mRNA levels. Consistent with parasite modulation of host eIF4A-sensitive translation to promote infection, silvestrol suppressed L. donovani replication within macrophages. In contrast, parasite survival was favored under mTOR inhibition. In summary, infection-associated changes in translation of mTOR- and eIF4A-sensitive mRNAs contribute to modulate mRNA metabolism and immune responses in L. donovani-infected macrophages. Although the net outcome of such translation programs favours parasite propagation, individual translation programs appear to have opposing roles during L. donovani infection, thereby suggesting their selective targeting as key for therapeutic effects.Author SummaryFine-tuning the efficiency of mRNA translation into proteins allows cells to tailor their responses to stress without the need for synthesizing new mRNA molecules. It is well established that the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani alters transcription of specific genes to subvert host cell functions. However, discrepancies between transcriptomic and proteomic data suggest that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms also contribute to modulate host gene expression programs during L. donovani infection. Herein, we report that one third of protein-coding mRNAs expressed in macrophages are differentially translated upon infection with L. donovani. Our computational analyses reveal that subsets of mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins share the same directionality of translational regulation, which is likely to impact metabolic and microbicidal activity of infected cells. We also show that upregulated translation of transcripts that encode central regulators of mRNA metabolism and inflammation is sensitive to the activation of mTOR or eIF4A during infection. Finally, we observe that inhibition of eIF4A activity reduces parasite survival within macrophages while selective blockade of mTOR has the opposite effect. Thus, our study points to a dual role for translational control of host gene expression during L. donovani infection and suggests that novel regulatory nodes could be targeted for therapeutic intervention.",2019-12-20,Visnu Chaparro; Louis-Philippe Leroux; Laia Masvidal; Julie Lorent; Tyson E.

We confirm that the expression level of IFITM3 plays a role in determining the level of viral infection through manipulation of IFITM3 levels with interferon (IFN) stimulation and overexpression systems. Low basal expression may put some immune cells, including lymphocytes and lung-resident macrophages, at risk of influenza virus infection. Investigating the induction of IFITM3 by IFN, we find a strong preference for Type I IFN in IFITM3 induction in both cell lines and primary human cells. While myeloid cells can increase expression following stimulation by Type I IFN, lymphocytes show minimal induction of IFITM3 following IFN stimulation, suggesting that they are always at risk of viral infection. Surprisingly, we found that the time it takes for maximal induction of IFITM3 is relatively slow for an interferon-stimulated gene at around 36 hours. Low basal expression and slow induction of IFITM3 could increase the risk of influenza virus infection in selected immune cells.ImportanceInfluenza virus infection remains one of the top ten threats to global health, causing significant deaths and hospitalisations across the world each year. Understanding mechanisms for controlling influenza virus infection remain a priority. The interferon-induced transmembrane protein IFITM3 can restrict influenza infection by limiting replication of the virus. The precise mechanisms of how IFITM3 reduced replication of influenza are unknown, although it is predicted to prevent release of viral contents into the cytosol by preventing pore formation on the endosomal compartments where it is suggested to reside.

However, our understanding of pathogen jumps is primarily based around viruses, despite bacteria accounting for the greatest proportion of zoonoses. Because bacterial pathogens in bats (Order: Chiroptera) can have conservation and human health consequences, studies that examine the ecological and evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers to pathogen sharing are crucially needed. We here studied hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., hemoplasmas) across a species-rich bat community in Belize over two years. Across 469 bats spanning 33 species, half of individuals and two-thirds of species were hemoplasma positive. Infection prevalence was higher for males and for species with larger body mass and colony sizes. Hemoplasmas displayed high genetic diversity (21 novel genotypes) and strong host specificity. Evolutionary patterns supported co-divergence of bats and bacterial genotypes alongside phylogenetically constrained host shifts. Bat species centrality to the network of shared hemoplasma genotypes was phylogenetically clustered and unrelated to prevalence, further suggesting rare—but detectable—bacterial sharing between species.

Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV.Author SummaryInfectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets.",2020-01-08,Sarah Krieg; Fabian Pott; Laura Eckei; Maud Verheirstraeten; Mareike Bütepage; Barbara Lippok; Christine Goffinet; Bernhard Lüscher; Patricia Verheugd,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.07.896977

Many of these RBPs localize several mRNAs and may have additional direct interaction partners to regulate their functions. Using immunoprecipitation from whole Drosophila ovaries coupled to mass spectrometry, we examined protein-protein associations of 6 GFP-tagged RBPs expressed at physiological levels. Analysis of the interaction network and further validation in human cells allowed us to identify 26 previously unknown associations, besides recovering several well characterized interactions. We identified interactions between RBPs and several splicing factors, providing links between nuclear and cytoplasmic events of mRNA regulation. Additionally, components of the translational and RNA decay machineries were selectively co-purified with some baits, suggesting a mechanism for how RBPs may regulate maternal transcripts. Given the evolutionary conservation of the studied RBPs, the interaction network presented here provides the foundation for future functional and structural studies of mRNA localization across metazoans.",2020-01-09,Prashali Bansal; Johannes Madlung; Kristina Schaaf; Boris Macek; Fulvia Bono,,,,True,biorxiv_medrxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.08.899146

PAR-2 is normally expressed basolaterally in differentiated nasal ciliated cells.ObjectiveWe tested if epithelial remodeling during diseases characterized by loss of cilia and squamous metaplasia may alter PAR-2 polarization.MethodsEndogenous PAR-2 responses were measured by live cell calcium and cilia imaging, measurement of fluid secretion, and quantification of cytokines. We utilized airway squamous cell lines, primary differentiated air-liquid interface cultures, and tissue explants. Cells were exposed to disease-related modifiers that alter epithelial morphology, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, and retinoic acid deficiency. We used concentrations and exposure times that altered epithelial morphology without causing breakdown of the epithelial barrier, likely reflecting early disease states.ResultsPAR-2 signaling in airway squamous cells activated calcium and inflammatory responses. Squamous cells cultured at air liquid interface (ALI) responded to PAR-2 agonists applied both apically and basolaterally. Primary well-differentiated nasal epithelial ALI cultures responded only to basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Primary cultures exposed to IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, or reduced retinoic acid responded to both apical and basolateral PAR-2 stimulation. Nasal polyp tissue, but not control middle turbinate, exhibited apical calcium responses to PAR-2 stimulation. However, isolated ciliated cells from both polyp and turbinate maintained basolateral PAR-2 polarization.ConclusionsSquamous metaplasia and/or loss of cilia enhances apical PAR-2 responses.

Numerous “hybrid correction” algorithms have been developed for genomic data that correct long reads by exploiting the accuracy and depth of short reads sequenced from the same sample. These algorithms are not suited for correcting more complex transcriptome sequencing data.ResultsWe have created a novel algorithm called TALC (Transcription Aware Long Read Correction) which models changes in RNA expression and isoform representation in a weighted De-Bruijn graph to correct long reads from transcriptome studies. We show that transcription aware correction by TALC improves the accuracy of the whole spectrum of downstream RNA-seq applications and is thus necessary for transcriptome analyses that use long read technology.Availability and ImplementationTALC is implemented in C++ and available at https://gitlab.igh.cnrs.fr/lbroseus/TALC.Contactwilliam.ritchie@igh.cnrs.fr,2020-01-11,Lucile Broseus; Aubin Thomas; Andrew J.

These include the internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5′ terminal 360 nucleotide stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs by selective 2′ hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential for replication, they provide genomes with a competitive advantage. However, although replicons and full-length genomes lacking all PKs were replication competent, no infectious virus was rescued from genomes containing less than one PK copy.

Recent emerging threats including the Zika and Ebola virus outbreaks highlight the cost and difficulty in responding rapidly. In low-resource areas, a key obstacle is quick and accurate detection of viruses near the point of care. To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches designed to mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show non-enzymatic detection of viral RNA to the attomole level, with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with a sample preparation step using either RNA extraction or isothermal pre-amplification. Our assay can be performed with minimal or no lab infrastructure, and is readily adaptable (with ∼24-hour development time) to detect other viruses. Given this versatility, we expect that further development and field implementation will improve our ability to detect emergent viral threats and ultimately limit their impact.",2020-01-16,Lifeng Zhou; Arun Richard Chandrasekaran; Jibin Abraham Punnoose; Gaston Bonenfant; Stephon Charles; Oksana Levchenko; Pheonah Badu; Cassandra Cavaliere; Cara T.

Ursidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, research on T cell immunology in this family, especially structural immunology, is lacking. In this study, the structure of the key trimolecular complex pMHC-1 (aka pAime-128), which binds a peptide from canine distemper virus, was solved for the first time using giant panda as a representative species of Ursidae. The structural characteristics of the giant panda pMHC-I complex, including the unique pockets in the peptide-binding groove (PBG), were analyzed in detail. Comparing the panda pMHC-I to others in the bear family and extending the comparison to other mammals revealed distinct features. The interaction between MHC-I and β2m, the features of pAime-128 involved in TCR docking and CD8 binding, the anchor sites in the PBG, and the CTL epitopes of potential viruses that infect pandas were concretely clarified. Unique features of pMHC-I viral antigen presentation in the panda were revealed by solving the three-dimensional structure of pAime-128. The distinct characteristics of pAime-128 indicate an unusual event that emerged during the evolution of the MHC system in the bear family. These results provide a new platform for research on panda CTL immunity and the design of vaccines for application in the bear family.IMPORTANCEUrsidae includes 5 genera and 8 species; however, the study of its immunology, especially structural immunology, is extremely rare to date.

In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.One Sentence SummaryIt is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human.

Among these viruses, La Crosse virus (LACV), a member of the California serogroup, circulates in the eastern and midwestern United States. While LACV infection is often asymptomatic, dozens of cases of encephalitis are reported yearly. Unfortunately, no antivirals have been approved to treat LACV infection. Here, we developed a method to rapidly test potential antivirals against LACV infection. From this screen, we identified several potential antiviral molecules, including known antivirals. Additionally, we identified many novel antivirals that exhibited antiviral activity without affecting cellular viability. Valinomycin, a potassium ionophore, was among our top targets. We found that valinomycin exhibited potent anti-LACV activity in multiple cell types in a dose-dependent manner. Valinomycin did not affect particle stability or infectivity, suggesting that it may preclude virus replication by altering cellular potassium ions, a known determinant of LACV entry. We extended these results to other ionophores and found that the antiviral activity of valinomycin extended to other viral families including bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Keystone virus), enteroviruses (Coxsackievirus, rhinovirus), flavirivuses (Zika), and coronaviruses (229E and MERS-CoV). In all viral infections, we observed significant reductions in virus titer in valinomycin-treated cells. In sum, we demonstrate the importance of potassium ions to virus infection, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to disrupt virus replication.ImportanceNo antivirals are approved for the treatment of bunyavirus infection. The ability to rapidly screen compounds and identify novel antivirals is one means to accelerate drug discovery for viruses with no approved treatments. We used this approach to screen hundreds of compounds against La Crosse virus, an emerging bunyavirus that causes significant disease, including encephalitis. We identified several known and previously unidentified antivirals. We focused on a potassium ionophore, valinomycin, due to its promising in vitro antiviral activity. We demonstrate that valinomycin, as well as a selection of other ionophores, exhibits activity against La Crosse virus as well as several other distantly related bunyaviruses. We finally observe that valinomycin has activity against a wide array of human viral pathogens, suggesting that disrupting potassium ion homeostasis with valinomycin may be a potent host pathway to target to quell virus infection.",2020-01-23,Zachary J.
